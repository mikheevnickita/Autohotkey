Get tired moving your right hand to the arroy key to select first item in code completion? <br><br>
I've got solution for you. Just install autohotkey and run this script. <br>
Then you got hotkeys for {Left, Right, Up, Down} arrow keys and {Home, End, Insert, Delete, PgUp, PgDown} keys <br>
Use hotkeys CapsLock + { J, L, I, K },  { H, :, Y, U, O, > } to faster navigation.<br>
